\chapter{Project description}
A Context-aware system is able to adapt its behaviour to the surroundings it is in. In order to act upon its environment, the system will need sensor-input. Various sources of input can be used to determine the actions of the system.\\

In this project we want to mainly focus on implementing a context-awareness framework, making it easy for systems to actuate on sensor events. As a proof of concept we will explore replacing the physical SCRUM board, which is often a whiteboard and post-its, with an IT-solution which is not confined to a personal computer, but has the same presence. The digital SCRUM board will be context-aware to the extent that it can recognize different SCRUM activities, like sprint meeting or one-on-one, and automatically change its graphical interface.
