\section{Project description}
A Context-aware system is able to adapt its behaviour to the surroundings it is in. In order to act upon its environment, the system will need sensor-input. Various sources of input can be used to determine the actions of the system.\\

In this project we want to mainly focus on implementing a context-awareness framework, making it easy for systems to actuate on sensor events. As a proof of concept we will explore replacing the physical SCRUM board, which is often a whiteboard and post-its, with an IT-solution which is not confined to a personal computer, but has the same presence. The digital SCRUM board will be context-aware to the extent that it can recognize different SCRUM activities, like sprint meeting or one-on-one, and automatically change its graphical interface.


\section{Scope of this project}

As per our Project description there are two artefacts to be made; The context awareness framework and a proof of concept implementation in form of a Context-aware Scrum board.

\paragraph{The Framework.} 
Our project description dictates that the main piece of work will be our framework, and so implementation of this framework will have the broadest scope.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{Goal 1 }] \textit{Our aim is to implement a framework that is adaptable and easy to use.}
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{The Scrum board.} 
For us to prove usability of the framework developed we will implement it for a context-aware Scrum board. The function of this artefact is solely to test the usefulness of the context-awareness framework.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{Goal 2 }] \textit{In trying to prove Goal 1, implement a stub Scrum board utilizing the framework}
\end{itemize}

It is not in our scope to implement a functional or useful Scrum board.
