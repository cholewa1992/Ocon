\paragraph{Ocon implementation}




\paragraph{Proof of concept}
When implementing Ocon we experienced a framework that is easy to use and has the flexibility needed for our proof of concept. Especially the OconTcpCom implementation increased ease of use in our case, but imaging that another communication than tcp was needed, Ocon would function exactly the same given that this communication implementation was done correctly. Apart from that ease of use has been good in the simplicity of initializing the different Ocon components.

With that said one implementation by the developers of the framework only gives a limited view on its real-world usefulness.
